# Week_Two_Homework
This is my portfolio website. I have designed it with a heading including my name. The header nav bar has links to various elements on the page, as well as a link to my resume, which I'll put in place once completed. 

The 'About Me' section includes a current photo as well as placeholder text. 

The Work section includes three placeholder images in place for my future work. I have designed the photos to function as links, but they currently link to '#'. 

The footer is designed to have placeholder contact information, which all currently link to '#'. 

With CSS, I designed the page to change colors from red to blue when viewed on smaller screens.
